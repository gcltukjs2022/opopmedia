          Clean air zones across the UK aim to reduce the number of polluting
          vehicles on the nation's roads. Any taxi that fails to meet emissions
          standards must pay a daily charge to drive anywhere in major cities
          such as London and Manchester. You wonâ€™t be charged in these zones
          with any Boomerang vehicle.
