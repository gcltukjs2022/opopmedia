        Clean air zones across the UK aim to reduce the number of polluting
        vehicles on the nation's roads. Any taxi that fails to meet emissions
        standards must pay a daily charge to drive anywhere in major cities such
        as London and Manchester. You wonâ€™t be charged in these zones with any
        Boomerang vehicle.
